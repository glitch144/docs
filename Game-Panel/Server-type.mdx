# Using the Server Type Tab  

The **Server Type Tab** in your XGamingServer control panel allows you to select and manage different server types for your game servers (e.g., Minecraft). This guide walks you through how to choose the right server type based on your needs and ensures compatibility with mods and plugins.

## Overview  

The Server Type Tab provides a curated list of server types (also known as "spigots" or "mod loaders") that are compatible with your game. Each server type is optimized for specific use cases, such as performance, mod support, or multiplayer functionality.
