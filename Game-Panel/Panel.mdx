Key Functions:

- Real-time command execution (Minecraft/Rust/ARK commands etc.)
- View live server logs and output
- Monitor resource usage when server is online
- Immediate server state control (start/stop/restart)

Usage Notes:

- When offline, only the Start button is active
- Right-click in the console for copy/paste options
- Graphs update every 10 seconds when the server is running

Troubleshooting Tips:

- If the console freezes, try refreshing the page
- "Offline" status may require manual start
- Command not working? Check game-specific syntax
- No response? Verify that the server is actually running

The console provides the most direct access to your server operations and is particularly useful for:

- Debugging issues
- Administering players
- Watching real-time server activity
- Executing game commands without direct server access
