# Adding Additional Server Ports

This comprehensive guide explains how to add and configure additional server ports for your game server on **XGamingServer** using the **Pterodactyl Panel**. Properly configuring ports is essential for ensuring smooth communication between your server and clients, especially when running custom mods, plugins, or services like voice chat.

---

## Overview

The **Additional Server Ports** feature allows you to:  
- Open specific ports for your game server (e.g., game traffic, RCON, or voice chat).  
- Ensure compatibility with mods/plugins requiring custom port configurations.  
- Avoid conflicts with other services or servers on the same node.  

Ports are crucial for allowing incoming and outgoing connections. By default, Pterodactyl assigns a primary port for your server, but you may need to open additional ports for advanced setups.

<Callout type="info">
Ports are like "doors" that allow external users to connect to your server. Each service (e.g., Minecraft, Teamspeak, etc.) requires specific ports to function correctly.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Log in to Pterodactyl Panel  
Navigate to [XGamingServer's Pterodactyl Panel](https://your-ptero-domain.com) and log in with your credentials. If youâ€™re unsure about your login details, check your email for the welcome message or contact support.

### Step 2: Select Your Server  
Once logged in, locate your game server in the server list. Click on the server name to access its management dashboard.

### Step 3: Configure Ports  
1. **Locate Port Settings**:  
   In the server dashboard, navigate to the **Settings** tab and find the **Ports** section. This section lists all currently assigned ports for your server.

2. **Add a New Port**:  
   Click **Add Port** and specify the following details:  
   - **Port Number**: The port you want to open (e.g., `25565` for Minecraft, `9987` for Teamspeak).  
   - **Protocol**: Choose `TCP`, `UDP`, or both. Most games use `UDP` for real-time communication, while some services (e.g., RCON, HTTP APIs) require `TCP`.  

   ```text
   Example Configuration:  
   Port: 25566  
   Protocol: TCP/UDP  
   ```

3. **Save Changes**:  
   After entering the details, click **Save** to apply the configuration. Pterodactyl will automatically update the serverâ€™s firewall rules to allow traffic on the specified port.

### Step 4: Update Server Configuration  
If your game or application requires manual port configuration, follow these steps:  

1. **Access File Manager**:  
   In the Pterodactyl panel, go to the **File Manager** tab to browse your server files.  

2. **Edit Configuration Files**:  
   Locate the relevant configuration file for your game or application and update the port value. Below are examples for popular games:  

   ```text
   # Example: Minecraft server.properties
   server-port=25566
   rcon.port=25575
   ```

   ```text
   # Example: Teamspeak ts3server.ini
   default_voice_port=9988
   ```

3. **Save the File**:  
   After making changes, save the file and exit the editor.

### Step 5: Restart the Server  
Restart your server for the changes to take effect. You can do this by clicking the **Restart** button in the Pterodactyl panel.

## Advanced Configurations

### Adding Multiple Ports  
If your server requires multiple ports (e.g., for different services), repeat **Step 3** for each port. For example:  
- Game traffic: `25565` (TCP/UDP)  
- Voice chat: `9987` (UDP)  
- RCON: `25575` (TCP)  

### Using Port Ranges  
Some applications require a range of ports (e.g., for multiple players or services). To configure a port range:  
1. Add the first port in the range (e.g., `10000`).  
2. Add the last port in the range (e.g., `10100`).  
3. Update your applicationâ€™s configuration to use the range.  

```text
Example: Port Range for Minecraft BungeeCord
server-port=10000-10100
```

## Important Notes  

- **Port Availability**: Ensure the port is not already in use by another service or server on the same node. Duplicate ports can cause connection issues.  
- **Firewall Rules**: XGamingServer automatically configures node firewalls, but if you encounter issues, contact support for assistance.  
- **Pterodactyl Variables**: Use environment variables like `SERVER_PORT` in startup commands if your application supports dynamic port assignment.  

<Callout type="warning">  
**Port Conflicts**: Do not reuse ports assigned to other servers on the same node. Always verify port availability before assigning.  
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting  

### Port Not Opening  
If the port you added does not seem to work:  
1. Verify the port is saved in Pterodactyl and matches your applicationâ€™s configuration.  
2. Check your gameâ€™s documentation for required protocols (`TCP` vs. `UDP`).  
3. Test the port using an online port checker tool (e.g., [canyouseeme.org](https://canyouseeme.org)).  

### Connection Issues  
If clients cannot connect to your server:  
1. Ensure your firewall/router allows traffic on the configured port.  
2. Verify the port is open on the serverâ€™s hosting node.  
3. Double-check your applicationâ€™s configuration file for typos or incorrect values.  

### Firewall Blockage  
If you suspect a firewall issue:  
1. Contact XGamingServer support to confirm the nodeâ€™s firewall rules.  
2. If you have a custom firewall setup, ensure the port is allowed.
