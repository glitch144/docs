# Installing Mods and Plugins

Enhance your Minecraft server by installing mods and plugins that add new features, mechanics, and functionality. This guide explains how to use the **Plugins** and **Modpacks** tabs in your XGamingServer control panel to install and manage mods/plugins seamlessly.

<info>
  This guide assumes you’ve already configured your Minecraft server. If not, refer to our [Basic Configuration Guide](/Minecraft/Basic-Setup).

## Overview

- **Plugins**: Small additions that enhance server functionality (e.g., permissions, chat management).
- **Mods**: Larger modifications that change gameplay mechanics or add new content.
- **Modpacks**: Pre-configured collections of mods for specific gameplay experiences (e.g., FTB, SkyFactory).

<tip>
  Use the **Plugins Tab** for individual mods/plugins and the **Modpacks Tab** for pre-configured modpacks.
