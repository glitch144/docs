## Steps to Configure World Settings  

### Step 1: Access `server.properties`  
1. Log in to the [XGamingServer Control Panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com).  
2. Select your server from the server list.  
3. Go to the **File Manager** tab and locate the `server.properties` file.  

### Step 2: Edit World Settings  
Below are some common settings you can customize:  

#### Spawn Protection  
Protect the spawn area from griefing:  
```properties
spawn-protection=16
```

#### Daylight Cycle  
Enable or disable the day-night cycle:  
```properties
do-daylight-cycle=true
```

#### Weather  
Disable weather effects:  
```properties
do-weather-cycle=false
```

#### Mob Spawning  
Control mob spawning:  
```properties
spawn-monsters=true
```

### Step 3: Save and Restart  
1. Save the changes to `server.properties`.  
2. Restart your server to apply the new settings.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Spawn Area Not Protected  
- **Cause**: `spawn-protection` value is too low or disabled.  
- **Solution**: Increase the `spawn-protection` radius in `server.properties`.  

### Issue: Weather Effects Persist  
- **Cause**: `do-weather-cycle` is enabled.  
- **Solution**: Set `do-weather-cycle=false` to disable weather.

## Best Practices  

- Use spawn protection to safeguard new players.  
- Disable weather and time cycles for roleplay servers.  
- Regularly test world settings to ensure they align with your server’s theme.
