The **Message of the Day (MOTD)** is the text displayed in the server list when players hover over your server. A well-crafted MOTD can make your server stand out and provide essential information to potential players.

  This guide assumes you’ve already configured your server. If not, refer to our [Basic Configuration Guide](/Minecraft/Basic-Setup).

## Overview

The MOTD is defined in the `server.properties` file under the `motd` field. You can use plain text or add color codes and formatting for a more visually appealing message.

---

## Steps to Customize Your MOTD

### Step 1: Access `server.properties`

1. Log in to the [XGamingServer Control Panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com).
2. Select your server from the server list.
3. Go to the **File Manager** tab and locate the `server.properties` file.

### Step 2: Edit the `motd` Field

1. Open the `server.properties` file for editing.
2. Locate the `motd` field. By default, it may look like this:

   ```properties
   motd=A Minecraft Server
   ```
3. Replace the text with your custom message. For example:

   ```properties
   motd=Welcome to My Awesome Server! Join us for epic adventures!
   ```
4. To add colors and formatting, use Minecraft’s **color codes**. For example:

   ```properties
   motd=§6Welcome §bto §aMy §cAwesome §eServer! §rJoin us for epic adventures!
   ```
   - `§6`: Gold
   - `§b`: Aqua
   - `§a`: Green
   - `§c`: Red
   - `§e`: Yellow
   - `§r`: Reset formatting

<tip>
  You can use tools like [Minecraft JSON Text Generator](https://minecraft.tools/en/json_text.php) to design complex MOTDs with colors and formatting.

### Step 3: Save and Restart

1. Save the changes to `server.properties`.
2. Restart your server to apply the new MOTD.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: MOTD Not Updating

- **Cause**: Changes were not saved or the server was not restarted.
- **Solution**:
  1. Double-check the `server.properties` file for typos.
  2. Restart the server to apply changes.

### Issue: Colors Not Displaying Correctly

- **Cause**: Incorrect or unsupported color codes.
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify that the color codes are valid (e.g., `§6` for gold).
  2. Avoid using unsupported characters or formatting.

## Best Practices

- Keep the MOTD concise but informative.
- Use colors sparingly to avoid overwhelming players.
- Include key details like server rules, features, or website links.
