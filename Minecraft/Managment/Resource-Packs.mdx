# Installing and Using Resource Packs for Your Minecraft Server  

Resource packs allow you to customize the textures, sounds, and visuals of your Minecraft server. This guide will walk you through installing and configuring resource packs using XGamingServerâ€™s control panel.

## Overview  

Resource packs are `.zip` files containing textures, sounds, and other assets. They can be applied globally (forced on all players) or optionally (players choose to enable them).

## Steps to Install a Resource Pack  

### Step 1: Download a Resource Pack  
1. Find a resource pack on platforms like [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com) or [Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com).  
2. Download the `.zip` file for the resource pack.  

### Step 2: Upload the Resource Pack  
1. Log in to the [XGamingServer Control Panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com).  
2. Select your server from the server list.  
3. Go to the **File Manager** tab.  
4. Navigate to the `resourcepacks` folder (create it if it doesnâ€™t exist).  
5. Upload the `.zip` file to the `resourcepacks` folder.  

### Step 3: Configure `server.properties`  
1. Open the `server.properties` file via the **File Manager**.  
2. Locate the `resource-pack` field and set it to the URL of your resource pack. For example:  

   ```properties
   resource-pack=https://example.com/resourcepack.zip
   ```

3. Optionally, enable `resource-pack-required=true` to force players to use the pack.  

### Step 4: Restart the Server  
1. Restart your server to apply the changes.  
2. Test the resource pack by joining the server.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Resource Pack Not Loading

- **Solution**:  
  1. Verify the URL is correct and accessible.  
  2. Re-upload the `.zip` file if necessary.  

### Issue: Players Cannot Connect  
- **Cause**: Forced resource packs may block players who decline them.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Set `resource-pack-required=false` to make the pack optional.

## Best Practices
