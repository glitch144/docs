## Steps to Set Up Custom Commands  

### Step 1: Install a Command Plugin  
1. Use the **Plugins Tab** to install a plugin like **EssentialsX**.  
2. Restart the server to load the plugin.  

### Step 2: Configure Commands  
1. Open the pluginâ€™s configuration file via the **File Manager** (e.g., `config.yml` for EssentialsX).  
2. Define custom commands. For example:  

   ```yaml
   # Example: EssentialsX config.yml
   aliases:
     home: /essentials:home
     tp: /essentials:tp
   ```

3. Save the file and restart the server.  

### Step 3: Use Commands In-Game  
- Use the custom commands in-game:  
  ```text
  /home
  /tp PlayerName
  ```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Command Not Working  
- **Cause**: Incorrect syntax or missing permissions.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Verify the command syntax in the pluginâ€™s documentation.  
  2. Assign permissions using a plugin like **LuckPerms**.  

### Issue: Plugin Conflicts  
- **Cause**: Overlapping commands from multiple plugins.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Rename conflicting commands in the pluginâ€™s config file.  
  2. Use `/help` to identify which plugin owns a command.

## Best Practices
