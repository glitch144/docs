## Steps to Configure Difficulty  

### Step 1: Access `server.properties`  
1. Log in to the [XGamingServer Control Panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com).  
2. Select your server from the server list.  
3. Go to the **File Manager** tab and locate the `server.properties` file.  

### Step 2: Edit the `difficulty` Field  
1. Open the `server.properties` file for editing.  
2. Locate the `difficulty` field. By default, it may look like this:  

   ```properties
   difficulty=easy
   ```

3. Change the value to your desired difficulty:  
   - `peaceful`  
   - `easy`  
   - `normal`  
   - `hard`  

   Example:  

   ```properties
   difficulty=hard
   ```

### Step 3: Save and Restart  
1. Save the changes to `server.properties`.  
2. Restart your server to apply the new difficulty.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Difficulty Not Changing  
- **Cause**: Changes were not saved or the server was not restarted.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Double-check the `server.properties` file for typos.  
  2. Restart the server to apply changes.  

### Issue: Players Find the Difficulty Too Hard  
- **Cause**: Mismatch between player expectations and server difficulty.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Lower the difficulty or make it configurable via commands.  
  2. Communicate the difficulty level in your MOTD or Discord.

## Best Practices  

- Match difficulty to your serverâ€™s theme (e.g., survival servers should use `normal` or `hard`).  
- Allow players to vote on difficulty settings if appropriate.  
- Regularly review feedback to ensure the difficulty level aligns with player preferences.
