## Overview  

The server icon is a small image (64x64 pixels) displayed next to your server name in the multiplayer list. It must be in `.png` format and named `server-icon.png`.

## Steps to Add a Custom Server Icon  

### Step 1: Create the Icon  
1. Use an image editor (e.g., Photoshop, GIMP, or Canva) to design your icon.  
2. Ensure the image meets these requirements:  
   - Size: 64x64 pixels.  
   - Format: `.png`.  
   - Transparency: Optional (supports transparent backgrounds).  

<Callout type="warning">  
Icons larger than 64x64 pixels or in other formats (e.g., `.jpg`) will not work.

### Step 2: Upload the Icon  
1. Log in to the [XGamingServer Control Panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com).  
2. Select your server from the server list.  
3. Go to the **File Manager** tab.  
4. Locate the root directory of your server (usually `/`).  
5. Upload your `server-icon.png` file to the root directory.  

### Step 3: Restart the Server  
1. Restart your server to apply the new icon.  
2. Verify the icon by viewing your server in the multiplayer list.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Icon Not Displaying  
- **Cause**: Incorrect file name or format.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Ensure the file is named exactly `server-icon.png`.  
  2. Verify the file is in `.png` format and 64x64 pixels.  

### Issue: Icon Looks Blurry  
- **Cause**: Image resolution or scaling issues.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Redesign the icon at 64x64 pixels without upscaling.  
  2. Use sharp, simple designs for better visibility.

## Best Practices  

- Use high-contrast colors for better visibility in the server list.  
- Include your serverâ€™s logo or branding for recognition.  
- Test the icon on multiple devices to ensure compatibility.
