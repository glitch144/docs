## Step 1: Access Your Server

1. Log in to the [XGamingServer Control Panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com).
2. Select your Minecraft server from the server list.

---

## Step 2: Choose a Server Type

1. Navigate to the **Server Type** tab.
2. Select a server type based on your needs:
   - **Paper**: Lightweight and optimized for performance (ideal for vanilla or semi-vanilla servers).
   - **Forge**: Required for modded servers (e.g., custom mods).
   - **Fabric**: Modern mod loader for advanced mod compatibility.
   - **Spigot**: Stable and widely used for plugins.

   <tip>
     For modded servers, ensure you’ve allocated enough RAM (8GB\+).
   </tip>

## Step 3: Allocate Resources

1. Go to the **Settings** tab.
2. Adjust resource allocations:

   ```text
   CPU: 1–2 cores for vanilla, 2–4 cores for modded.  
   RAM: 4GB for vanilla, 8GB+ for modded.  
   Disk Space: 5–10GB for vanilla, 20GB+ for modded.  
   ```

   <warning>
     Under-allocating resources can lead to crashes or poor performance.
   </warning>

## Step 4: Configure `server.properties`

1. Navigate to the **File Manager** tab.
2. Locate and edit the `server.properties` file.
3. Update key settings:

   ```properties
   # Basic Settings
   gamemode=survival          # Options: survival, creative, adventure
   difficulty=easy            # Options: peaceful, easy, normal, hard
   level-name=world           # Name of your world folder
   online-mode=true           # Enable Mojang authentication (set to "false" for cracked servers)
   
   # Multiplayer Settings
   max-players=20             # Maximum players allowed
   view-distance=8            # Render distance (lower for better performance)
   ```
4. Save the file and restart the server.

---

## Step 5: Set Up Permissions (Optional)

1. Install a permissions plugin like **LuckPerms** via the **Plugins Tab**.
2. Configure permissions using commands or the plugin’s config file.

   ```text
   Example Commands:  
   /lp creategroup admin  
   /lp group admin permission set * true  
   ```

---

## Step 6: Enable Backups

1. Navigate to the **Backups** tab.
2. Schedule automatic backups (e.g., daily at 2 AM).
3. Download a backup to test restoration.

   <tip>
     Regular backups are crucial for recovering from crashes or data loss.
   </tip>

---

## Step 8: Secure Your Server

1. Enable **2FA** for your XGamingServer account.
2. Install anti-cheat plugins like **NoCheatPlus** (via the **Plugins Tab**).

---

## Step 9: Test Your Server

1. Start the server and wait for it to load.
2. Join using your Minecraft client:
   - **Direct Connect**: `your-server-ip:port`
   - **Domain**: If you’ve set up a custom domain (e.g., `play.example.com`).

---

## Step 10: Invite Players

1. Share your server IP or domain with friends.
2. For public servers, list it on platforms like [Minecraft Server List](https://minecraft-server-list.com).

## Final Checklist

✅ Server type selected and resources allocated.\
✅ `server.properties` configured.\
✅ Ports opened and backups enabled.\
