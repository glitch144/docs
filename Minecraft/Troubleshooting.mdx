## Issue 1: Server Crashes

### Symptoms

- The server stops unexpectedly.
- Players are disconnected without warning.

### Possible Causes and Solutions

- **Solution**:
  1. Check the **Logs Tab** for error messages related to plugins/mods.
  2. Update outdated plugins/mods via the **Plugins Tab** or manually.

## Issue 2: Lag or Low TPS

### Symptoms

- Gameplay feels slow or unresponsive.
- Ticks Per Second (TPS) drops below 20.

### Possible Causes and Solutions

#### Cause: High View Distance

- **Solution**:
  1. Lower the `view-distance` in `server.properties`:

     ```properties
     view-distance=6
     ```
  2. Restart the server to apply changes.

#### Cause: Resource-Heavy Mods/Plugins

- **Solution**:
  1. Use **Spark** or **Timings** to identify problematic mods/plugins.
  2. Remove or replace resource-heavy mods/plugins.

#### Cause: Excessive Entities

- **Solution**:
  1. Install **ClearLag** via the **Plugins Tab**.
  2. Configure it to remove lag-causing entities automatically.

## Issue 3: Connection Errors

### Symptoms

- Players cannot connect to the server.
- Error messages like "Connection Refused" or "Invalid Session."

#### Cause: Incorrect IP or Port

- **Solution**:
  1. Verify the server’s IP and port in the **Settings** tab.
  2. Ensure players use the correct connection details (e.g., `your-server-ip:25565`).

#### Cause: Firewall Restrictions

- **Solution**:
  1. Open the required ports (default: `25565`) in your firewall.
  2. Follow our [Adding Additional Server Ports](/guides/additional-server-ports) guide for instructions.

#### Cause: Online Mode Disabled

## Issue 4: Plugin/Mod Conflicts

### Symptoms

## Issue 5: Backup Failures

### Symptoms

## Issue 6: Proxy Routing Issues

### Symptoms

- Players cannot connect to specific servers via the proxy.
