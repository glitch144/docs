# Setting Up a Proxy for Minecraft Servers  

A proxy (e.g., **Velocity**, **BungeeCord**) allows you to manage multiple servers under a single connection, improving scalability and player routing. This guide will walk you through setting up and configuring a proxy using XGamingServer’s control panel.  

<Callout type="info">  
This guide assumes you’ve already configured your server. If not, refer to our [Basic Configuration Guide](/guides/minecraft-basic-config).

## Overview  

Proxies are essential for:  
- Connecting multiple servers (e.g., lobby, survival, minigames).  
- Improving player routing and reducing latency.  
- Handling authentication and load balancing.  

Popular proxies include **Velocity** (modern, lightweight) and **BungeeCord** (widely used).

## Steps to Set Up a Proxy  

### Step 1: Navigate to the Proxy Tab  
1. Log in to the [XGamingServer Control Panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com).  
2. Select your server from the server list.  
3. Go to the **Proxy** tab in the server dashboard.  

### Step 2: Add a New Proxy  
1. Click **Add** to create a new proxy.  
2. Fill out the required details:  
   - **PROXY DOMAIN**: Enter a domain (e.g., `proxy.example.com`).  
   - **ALLOCATION**: Select an IP and port for the proxy.  
   - **ENABLE SSL**: Toggle SSL for secure connections.  
   - **USE LET'S ENCRYPT**: Enable Let’s Encrypt for automatic SSL certificates.  

3. Save the configuration.

### Step 3: Connect Servers to the Proxy  

1. Open the proxy configuration file (e.g., `velocity.toml`) via the **File Manager**.  
2. Add the IPs and ports of your connected servers:  

   ```toml
   [[servers]]
   name = "lobby"
   address = "lobby-server-ip:25565"

   [[servers]]
   name = "survival"
   address = "survival-server-ip:25566"
   ```

3. Restart the proxy to apply changes.  

---

### Step 4: Test the Proxy  

1. Join the proxy using its domain or IP (e.g., `proxy.example.com`).  
2. Verify that players can connect to all linked servers.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Proxy Not Routing Players Correctly  
- **Cause**: Incorrect server IPs or ports in the proxy configuration.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Verify the IPs and ports in the proxy config file.  
  2. Restart the proxy and connected servers.  

### Issue: SSL Certificate Errors  
- **Cause**: Misconfigured SSL settings or invalid domain.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Ensure the domain is valid and points to the correct IP.  
  2. Disable and re-enable SSL if necessary.

## Best Practices  

- Use a dedicated proxy server for optimal performance.  
- Regularly monitor logs for errors or unusual activity.  
- Secure connections with SSL encryption.
