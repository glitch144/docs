    - **Pull File**
      - Download files from external URLs directly to your server.

    - **Clicking a file** opens it in:
      - **Built-in editor** (for text files like `.yml`, `.txt`).

    ### **Troubleshooting**

    | **Issue**           | **Solution**                                                        |
    | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | "Permission Denied" | Use **Permissions** option to set `755` (folders) or `644` (files). |
    | Upload fails        | Check disk space (`7.96 GiB` left in your case).                    |
    | Broken archives     | Re-upload or use **Pull File** with direct download links.          |

    ---

    ### **Pro Tips**

    - **Backup first** → Use the **Backups** tab before mass deletions.
    - **Use Archives** → Compress old logs/worlds to save space.
    - **Case-sensitive** → `Config.yml` ≠ `config.yml` on Linux servers.

Key Functions:

- Real-time command execution (Minecraft/Rust/ARK commands etc.)
- View live server logs and output
- Monitor resource usage when server is online
- Immediate server state control (start/stop/restart)

Usage Notes:

- When offline, only the Start button is active
- Right-click in the console for copy/paste options
- Graphs update every 10 seconds when the server is running

Troubleshooting Tips:

- If the console freezes, try refreshing the page
- "Offline" status may require manual start
- Command not working? Check game-specific syntax
- No response? Verify that the server is actually running

The console provides the most direct access to your server operations and is particularly useful for:

- Debugging issues
- Administering players
- Watching real-time server activity
- Executing game commands without direct server access
