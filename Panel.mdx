Key Functions:

Usage Notes:

- When offline, only Start button is active
- Command history available with up/down arrows
- Right-click in console for copy/paste options
- Graphs update every 10 seconds when server is running

Troubleshooting Tips:

- If console freezes, try refreshing page
- "Offline" status may require manual start
- Command not working? Check game-specific syntax
- No response? Verify server is actually running

The console provides the most direct access to your server operations and is particularly useful for:

- Debugging issues
- Administering players
- Watching real-time server activity
- Executing game commands without direct server access
