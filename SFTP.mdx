## Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before beginning, ensure you have:
- Active game server on Xgamingserver's Pterodactyl panel
- SFTP client software installed (recommended options):
  - [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) (Windows/macOS/Linux)
  - [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) (Windows)
  - [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) (macOS/Windows)
- Your Pterodactyl panel login credentials
- Server IP address (provided in your welcome email)

## Locating Your SFTP Credentials <a name="locating-your-sftp-credentials"></a>

1. Log in to your Pterodactyl panel at: `https://panel.xgamingserver.com`
2. Select your game server from the dashboard
3. In the server management interface, look for the "SFTP Details" section (typically in the sidebar or under "Server Configuration")
4. Note these critical details:
   - **Hostname**: `sftp.xgamingserver.com` or your dedicated server IP
   - **Port**: `2022` (default Pterodactyl SFTP port)
   - **Username**: This is your panel username (email address) + server identifier (e.g., `user@email.com-server`)
   - **Password**: Your Pterodactyl account password (or dedicated SFTP password if configured)
   - **Connection Protocol**: Must be SFTP (not regular FTP)

Important: If you don't see SFTP details, contact Xgamingserver support as your user account may need SFTP permissions enabled.

## Connecting with FileZilla <a name="connecting-with-filezilla"></a>

### Initial Setup
1. Launch FileZilla and open Site Manager (File > Site Manager or Ctrl+S)
2. Click "New Site" and name it (e.g., "Xgamingserver - MyServer")
3. Configure the connection:
   - Protocol: SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol
   - Host: Your server hostname or IP
   - Port: 2022
   - Logon Type: Normal
   - User: Your full SFTP username (including server identifier)
   - Password: Your SFTP password

### First Connection
1. Click "Connect"
2. If prompted about an unknown host key:
   - Verify the fingerprint matches one of these (check with support if unsure):
     ````bash
     RSA: SHA256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
     ECDSA: SHA256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
     ````
   - Check "Always trust this host" if verified
   - Click "OK"

### Post-Connection
- The remote directory will automatically open at `/home/container/`
- Left panel shows your local files, right panel shows server files
- Drag-and-drop files between panels to transfer

## Connecting with WinSCP <a name="connecting-with-winscp"></a>

1. Launch WinSCP and click "New Session"
2. Select "SFTP" as file protocol
3. Enter connection details:
   - Host name: Your server hostname or IP
   - Port number: 2022
   - User name: Full SFTP username
   - Password: Your SFTP password
4. Click "Save" to store these credentials
5. Click "Login" to connect
6. When asked about server host key, verify the fingerprint matches:
   - Click "Yes" to continue and cache the key

## Command Line Connection <a name="command-line-connection"></a>

For Linux/macOS terminals or Windows (using PuTTY or WSL):

````bash
sftp -P 2022 username@hostname.xgamingserver.com

Example with actual credentials:

```bash
sftp -P 2022 john@example.com-server@sftp.xgamingserver.com
```
## Command Line Connection <a name="command-line-connection"></a>

When prompted, enter your password. Once connected, you'll see the `sftp>` prompt.

Common commands:

```bash
ls            # List files
cd directory  # Change directory
get filename  # Download file
put filename  # Upload file
exit          # Close connection
```

## File System Navigation <a name="file-system-navigation"></a>

After successful connection, you'll have access to these key directories:

```bash
/home/container/       # Main server directory containing:
  /plugins/           # Bukkit/Spigot plugins
  /mods/              # Forge/Fabric mods
  /world/             # World save files
  server.properties   # Main configuration file
  # Other game-specific configuration files
```

Important Notes:
- The container is chrooted - you cannot access files outside `/home/container/`
- File permissions are maintained - some files may be read-only
- Configuration changes often require server restart to take effect

## Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>

### Connection Issues

**"Connection refused" or timeout:**
```bash
# Verify server status via Pterodactyl console
service status
# Check connection
telnet sftp.xgamingserver.com 2022
```

**"Authentication failed":**
- Ensure username format: `email+server@domain.com`
- Reset password in Pterodactyl panel
- Check for special characters in password

**"Host key verification failed":**
```bash
# Remove old host key (Linux/Mac)
ssh-keygen -R sftp.xgamingserver.com
```

### File Transfer Issues

**Permission denied when uploading:**
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la /home/container/
# Set permissions (via Pterodactyl console)
chmod 755 filename
```

**Incomplete transfers:**
```bash
# Check disk space
df -h /home/container
```

## Security Recommendations <a name="security-recommendations"></a>

### SSH Key Setup
```bash
# Generate keys (in Pterodactyl panel)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

### Connection Security
```bash
# Verify host fingerprint
ssh-keyscan -p 2022 sftp.xgamingserver.com
```
