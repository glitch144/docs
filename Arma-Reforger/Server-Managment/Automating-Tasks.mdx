# Automating Tasks in Arma Reforger  

Automation simplifies server management by handling repetitive tasks like restarts, backups, and announcements. This guide will show you how to set up automation using Enforce Script or third-party tools.

<Callout type="info">  
This guide assumes youâ€™ve already set up your server. If not, refer to our [Basic Setup Guide](/getting-started/basic-setup).

## Overview  

Automation can be achieved through:  
- **Enforce Script**: Schedule tasks directly within the game.  
- **Third-Party Tools**: Use external tools like cron jobs or server management panels.  

---

## Steps to Automate Tasks  

### Step 1: Use Enforce Script for In-Game Automation  
Below is an example of a script that broadcasts a message every hour:  

```javascript
// Broadcast hourly messages
onGameTick(() => {
    let currentTime = getTimeOfDay();
    if (currentTime % 1 === 0) { // Every hour
        broadcastMessage("Welcome to the server! Enjoy your stay.");
    }
});
```

---

### Step 2: Use Cron Jobs for External Automation  
If youâ€™re using a Linux-based server, you can use `cron` to schedule tasks:  

1. Open the terminal and run:  
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add a cron job to restart the server daily at midnight:  
   ```bash
   0 0 * * * ./arma-reforger-server restart
   ```

---

### Step 3: Automate Backups  
Use a script to back up your server files regularly:  

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backup script
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
tar -czf /backups/server-backup-$DATE.tar.gz /path/to/server/files
```

Schedule this script using `cron`:  
```bash
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup-script.sh
```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Tasks Not Running  
- **Cause**: Incorrect scheduling or missing permissions.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Verify cron jobs or script paths.  
  2. Ensure scripts have execute permissions (`chmod +x script.sh`).  

### Issue: Overlapping Tasks  
- **Cause**: Multiple scripts running simultaneously.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Use unique timestamps or logs to avoid overlaps.  
  2. Test tasks individually before combining them.  

---

## Best Practices  

- Log all automated tasks for debugging.  
- Test automation scripts in a staging environment before deploying them to production.  
- Regularly review and update scheduled tasks to ensure they remain relevant.
