## Overview  

Key security measures include:  
- Enabling firewalls and DDoS protection.  
- Setting up two-factor authentication (2FA).  
- Regularly backing up server files.  

---

## Steps to Secure Your Server  

### Step 1: Enable Firewalls  
1. Use a firewall to restrict access to your server.  
2. Allow traffic only on required ports (e.g., `2302 UDP`).  

---

### Step 2: Set Up 2FA  
Enable 2FA for admin accounts to prevent unauthorized access:  
```text
/auth enable-2fa
```

---

### Step 3: Monitor Logs for Suspicious Activity  
Regularly check logs for signs of unauthorized access:  
```bash
# Example: Analyze logs for login attempts
grep "login" server.log
```

---

## Steps to Set Up Backups  

### Step 1: Create a Backup Script  
Write a script to back up server files:  

```bash
#!/bin/bash
tar -czf backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /path/to/server/files
```

---

### Step 2: Schedule Backups  
Use a task scheduler like **Cron** to run the script daily:  
```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/backup-script.sh
```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Backups Fail  
- **Cause**: Insufficient disk space or missing files.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Free up disk space or increase storage.  
  2. Ensure all required files are included in the backup.  

### Issue: Unauthorized Access  
- **Cause**: Weak passwords or disabled firewalls.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.  
  2. Enable firewalls and restrict access to trusted IPs.  

---

## Best Practices  

- Store backups off-site (e.g., cloud storage).  
- Regularly test backups to ensure they can be restored.  
- Keep software and plugins updated to patch vulnerabilities.
