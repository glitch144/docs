## Overview  

Common performance issues include high latency, low frame rates, and server crashes. Optimization involves:  
- Allocating resources effectively.  
- Managing mods and assets.  
- Monitoring server logs for bottlenecks.  

---

## Steps to Optimize Performance  

### Step 1: Allocate Resources  
Adjust CPU, RAM, and bandwidth settings in your hosting panel:  

```table
| Resource     | Recommended Allocation       |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| CPU          | 2-4 cores                    |
| RAM          | 8-16 GB                      |
| Bandwidth    | 100 Mbps or higher           |
```

---

### Step 2: Manage Mods  
1. Limit the number of active mods to reduce overhead.  
2. Prioritize lightweight mods over resource-heavy ones.  

---

### Step 3: Monitor Logs  
Use logs to identify performance bottlenecks:  
```bash
# Example: Analyze logs for errors
tail -n 100 server.log | grep "error"
```

---

## Advanced Techniques  

### Technique 1: Reduce View Distance  
Lower the view distance to improve performance:  
```properties
view-distance=1500
```

### Technique 2: Optimize AI Behavior  
Reduce the number of AI units or simplify their behaviors:  
```javascript
// Reduce AI patrol frequency
setPatrolFrequency(enemyGroup, 60); // Patrol every 60 seconds
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: High Latency  
- **Cause**: Insufficient bandwidth or overloaded server.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Upgrade your hosting plan or use a dedicated provider.  
  2. Limit the number of players during peak hours.  

### Issue: Low Frame Rates  
- **Cause**: Too many entities or complex scripts.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Reduce the number of active entities.  
  2. Optimize scripts for efficiency.

## Best Practices  

- Regularly monitor server performance metrics.  
- Test changes in a staging environment before deploying them.  
- Keep mods and assets updated to ensure compatibility.
