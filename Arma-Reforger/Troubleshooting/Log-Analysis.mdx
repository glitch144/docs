## Overview  

Logs provide detailed information about server activity, errors, and player actions. Understanding how to analyze them is critical for troubleshooting.

---

## Steps to Analyze Logs  

### Step 1: Locate the Logs  
1. Navigate to the serverâ€™s log directory (e.g., `/logs`).  
2. Open the latest log file (e.g., `server.log`).  

---

### Step 2: Identify Errors  
Look for keywords like `error`, `warning`, or `crash`:  
```bash
# Example: Search for errors
grep "error" server.log
```

---

### Step 3: Interpret Log Entries  
Analyze log entries to understand the issue:  

Example Entry:  
```text
[ERROR] Failed to load mod: Missing dependency XYZ
```
- **Cause**: The mod requires a missing dependency.  
- **Solution**: Install the required dependency or disable the mod.  

---

### Step 4: Resolve Issues  
Take action based on the log findings:  
1. Update outdated files or mods.  
2. Adjust server settings to prevent overloads.  
3. Notify players about resolved issues.  

---

## Examples of Log Analysis  

### Example 1: Identifying Mod Conflicts  
```text
[WARNING] Mod A conflicts with Mod B
```
- **Solution**: Disable one of the conflicting mods.  

### Example 2: Detecting High Resource Usage  
```text
[WARNING] CPU usage exceeded 90%
```
- **Solution**: Reduce active entities or upgrade hosting.  

---

## Troubleshooting Common Challenges  

### Challenge: Overwhelming Log Size  
- **Cause**: Excessive logging or long-running sessions.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Rotate logs daily to manage size.  
  2. Focus on recent entries for troubleshooting.  

### Challenge: Ambiguous Error Messages  
- **Cause**: Lack of context in logs.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Cross-reference timestamps with player reports.  
  2. Reproduce the issue to gather more data.
