     | Storage         | 20 GB free space            |
     ```

2. **Install SteamCMD (Optional)**:

### Step 2: Configure Server Settings

   - Navigate to the `Config` folder in your Arma Reforger installation directory.  
   - Open the `server.cfg` file for editing.  

2. **Edit Key Settings**:  
   Below are some common settings you can customize:  

   ```properties
   # Server Name
   hostname=My Arma Reforger Server

   # Maximum Players
   maxPlayers=20

   # Password (Optional)
   password=SecurePassword123

   # Mission Selection
   mission=DefaultMissionName
   ```

3. **Save and Exit**:  
   - Save the changes to `server.cfg`.

### Step 3: Start the Server  
1. **Run the Server Locally**:  
   - Use the following command to start the server:  
     ```bash
     ./arma-reforger-server.exe -config=Config/server.cfg
     ```
   - Ensure the server launches without errors.  

2. **Test Connectivity**:  
   - Join the server from another device using its IP address.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Server Not Starting  
- **Cause**: Missing dependencies or incorrect configuration.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Verify that all required files are present.  
  2. Check the `server.cfg` file for syntax errors.  

### Issue: Unable to Connect  
- **Cause**: Firewall restrictions or incorrect IP.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Open the required ports (default: `2302 UDP`).  
  2. Ensure the serverâ€™s IP is correct and reachable.

## Best Practices
