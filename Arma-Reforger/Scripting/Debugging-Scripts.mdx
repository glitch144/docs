## Overview  

Common script errors include syntax mistakes, logical flaws, and performance bottlenecks. Debugging tools like logs and testing environments help you isolate and resolve these issues.

---

## Steps to Debug Scripts  

### Step 1: Enable Logging  
Use the `log()` function to output debug information:  

```javascript
// Log player health
onPlayerJoin(player => {
    let health = player.getHealth();
    log(`Player ${player.getName()} joined with health: ${health}`);
});
```

### Step 2: Analyze Logs  
1. Check the server logs for error messages or unexpected behavior.  
2. Look for stack traces or line numbers to pinpoint issues.

## Common Debugging Techniques  

### Technique 1: Isolate the Problem  
Comment out sections of the script to narrow down the issue:  

```javascript
// Comment out parts of the script
/*
onPlayerJoin(player => {
    let health = player.getHealth();
    log(`Health: ${health}`);
});
*/
```

### Technique 2: Use Breakpoints  
Simulate breakpoints by pausing execution with `sleep()`:  

```javascript
// Pause execution for debugging
onPlayerJoin(player => {
    sleep(5); // Pauses for 5 seconds
    log(`Player ${player.getName()} joined`);
});
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Syntax Errors  
- **Cause**: Missing semicolons, brackets, or invalid keywords.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Double-check the script for typos.  
  2. Use a code editor with syntax highlighting.  

### Issue: Logical Errors  
- **Cause**: Incorrect conditions or calculations.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Add `log()` statements to track variable values.  
  2. Test scripts step-by-step in single-player mode.

## Best Practices  

- Use consistent formatting for readability.  
- Test scripts in small environments before scaling up.  
- Document known issues and solutions for future reference.
