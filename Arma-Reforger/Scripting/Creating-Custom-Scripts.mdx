# Creating Custom Scripts in Arma Reforger  

Custom scripts allow you to add unique behaviors, triggers, and interactions to your missions or server. This guide will walk you through writing and deploying custom scripts using Enforce Script.

<Callout type="info">  
This guide assumes youâ€™ve already set up your server or mission. If not, refer to our [Basic Setup Guide](/getting-started/basic-setup).

## Overview  

Custom scripts can be used to:  
- Automate repetitive tasks.  
- Create dynamic events (e.g., respawning enemies).  
- Modify player behavior (e.g., healing, damage).

## Steps to Create a Custom Script  

### Step 1: Define the Purpose  
Decide what the script should do. For example:  
- Spawn vehicles at specific locations.  
- Trigger explosions when players enter an area.  

### Step 2: Write the Script  
Below is an example of a script that spawns a vehicle when a player enters a trigger zone:  

```javascript
// Spawn vehicle on trigger
onTriggerEnter(triggerZone, player => {
    let vehicleType = "Truck"; // Replace with desired vehicle type
    let spawnLocation = triggerZone.getLocation();
    let vehicle = spawnVehicle(vehicleType, spawnLocation);
    log(`Vehicle ${vehicleType} spawned at ${spawnLocation}`);
});
```

### Step 3: Attach the Script  
1. Save the script file (e.g., `spawn-vehicle.es`).  
2. Attach it to the mission or server by referencing it in the `server.cfg` or mission configuration:  
   ```properties
   scripts=spawn-vehicle.es
   ```

### Step 4: Test the Script  
1. Reload the mission or server.  
2. Enter the trigger zone and verify that the vehicle spawns.

## Advanced Script Examples  

### Example 1: Dynamic Weather Changes  
```javascript
// Change weather based on time
onGameTick(() => {
    let currentTime = getTimeOfDay();
    if (currentTime > 18 || currentTime < 6) {
        setWeather("Rain");
    } else {
        setWeather("Clear");
    }
});
```

### Example 2: Persistent Player Data  
```javascript
// Save player progress
onPlayerLeave(player => {
    let playerName = player.getName();
    let playerScore = player.getScore();
    saveData(playerName, { score: playerScore });
    log(`Saved progress for ${playerName}: Score ${playerScore}`);
});
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Script Conflicts  
- **Cause**: Overlapping triggers or duplicate scripts.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Use unique function names to avoid conflicts.  
  2. Disable unused scripts to reduce overlap.  

### Issue: Performance Impact  
- **Cause**: Inefficient loops or excessive logging.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Optimize loops and reduce unnecessary calculations.  
  2. Limit `log()` usage to critical debugging points.

## Best Practices  

- Use comments to explain complex logic.  
- Test scripts in small environments before scaling up.  
- Share reusable scripts with the community to foster collaboration.
