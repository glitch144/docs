## Key Features of Enforce Script  

| Feature           | Description                                      | Example Usage                     |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Variables         | Store and manipulate data.                       | `let health = 100;`               |
| Functions         | Define reusable blocks of code.                  | `function heal(player) { ... }`   |
| Event Triggers    | Respond to in-game events like player actions.   | `onPlayerJoin(player => { ... })` |
| Loops             | Repeat actions or processes.                     | `for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { ... }` |

## Steps to Get Started with Scripting  

### Step 1: Access the Script Editor  
1. Open the **Mission Editor** or **Server Configuration**.  
2. Navigate to the **Scripts** tab.  
3. Create a new script file (e.g., `custom-script.es`).  

### Step 2: Write Your First Script  
Below is an example of a simple script that heals players when they join:  

```javascript
// Heal players on join
onPlayerJoin(player => {
    let maxHealth = 100;
    player.setHealth(maxHealth);
    log(`Player ${player.getName()} has been healed!`);
});
```

### Step 3: Save and Test  
1. Save the script file.  
2. Reload the mission or server to apply changes.  
3. Test the script by joining the server and observing the results.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Script Not Running  
- **Cause**: Syntax errors or missing dependencies.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Check the script for typos or missing semicolons.  
  2. Ensure the script file is correctly referenced in your mission or server configuration.  

### Issue: Unexpected Behavior  
- **Cause**: Logical errors in the script.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Use `log()` to debug and track variable values.  
  2. Test scripts in single-player mode before deploying them to multiplayer.

## Best Practices  

- Use descriptive variable and function names for readability.  
- Modularize your scripts by breaking them into smaller functions.  
- Regularly test scripts to ensure compatibility with updates.
