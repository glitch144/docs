# Persistence and Save Systems in Arma Reforger  

Persistence allows you to save player progress, world states, and other data between sessions. This guide will show you how to implement save systems using Enforce Script.

This guide assumes youâ€™re familiar with scripting. If not, refer to our [Introduction to Scripting Guide](/scripting/introduction-to-scripting).

## Overview  

Persistence is essential for creating immersive experiences where player actions have long-term effects. You can use Enforce Script to save and load data such as:  
- Player stats (e.g., health, score).  
- World states (e.g., destroyed buildings, captured zones).

## Steps to Implement Persistence  

### Step 1: Save Player Data  
Use the `saveData()` function to store player information:  

```javascript
// Save player progress
onPlayerLeave(player => {
    let playerName = player.getName();
    let playerStats = {
        health: player.getHealth(),
        score: player.getScore(),
        inventory: player.getInventory()
    };
    saveData(playerName, playerStats);
    log(`Progress saved for ${playerName}`);
});
```

### Step 2: Load Player Data  
Use the `loadData()` function to restore player information:  

```javascript
// Load player progress
onPlayerJoin(player => {
    let playerName = player.getName();
    let playerStats = loadData(playerName);
    if (playerStats) {
        player.setHealth(playerStats.health);
        player.setScore(playerStats.score);
        player.setInventory(playerStats.inventory);
        log(`Progress loaded for ${playerName}`);
    }
});
```

## Saving World States  

### Example: Save Captured Zones  
```javascript
// Save captured zones
onGameSave(() => {
    let capturedZones = getCapturedZones(); // Assume this function exists
    saveData("capturedZones", capturedZones);
    log("World state saved: Captured zones");
});

// Load captured zones
onGameLoad(() => {
    let capturedZones = loadData("capturedZones");
    if (capturedZones) {
        restoreCapturedZones(capturedZones); // Assume this function exists
        log("World state loaded: Captured zones");
    }
});
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Data Not Saving  
- **Cause**: Missing `saveData()` calls or incorrect keys.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Verify that `saveData()` is called with unique keys.  
  2. Check the server logs for errors during saving.  

### Issue: Data Corruption  
- **Cause**: Improper data formatting or incomplete saves.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Use JSON-compatible formats for saved data.  
  2. Validate data before saving or loading.  

---

## Best Practices  

- Use descriptive keys for saved data (e.g., `player-stats`, `world-state`).  
- Regularly back up saved data to prevent loss.  
- Test persistence systems thoroughly before deploying them to production.
