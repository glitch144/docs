# Using Custom Assets in Arma Reforger  

Custom assets allow you to personalize your Arma Reforger server by adding unique textures, models, and sounds. This guide will walk you through importing and using custom assets effectively.

## Overview  

Custom assets can include:  
- **Textures**: Custom skins for vehicles or characters.  
- **Models**: Unique objects or structures.  
- **Sounds**: Custom audio effects or music.  

---

## Steps to Use Custom Assets  

### Step 1: Prepare Your Assets  
1. Create or download assets from platforms like [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/).  
2. Ensure assets are in compatible formats (e.g., `.p3d` for models, `.ogg` for sounds).  

---

### Step 2: Import Assets  
1. Place assets in the appropriate directory (e.g., `Assets/Textures`).  
2. Reference assets in your mission or script:  
   ```javascript
   // Example: Load a custom texture
   let customTexture = loadTexture("Assets/Textures/CustomSkin.paa");
   applyTexture(vehicle, customTexture);
   ```

---

### Step 3: Test Assets  
1. Launch the mission to verify that assets load correctly.  
2. Check for errors in the console or logs if assets fail to load.  

---

## Examples of Custom Assets  

### Example 1: Custom Vehicle Skin  
```javascript
// Apply a custom skin to a vehicle
let vehicle = spawnVehicle("Truck", spawnLocation);
let customSkin = loadTexture("Assets/Textures/CustomTruckSkin.paa");
applyTexture(vehicle, customSkin);
```

### Example 2: Custom Sound Effect  
```javascript
// Play a custom sound when an event occurs
onEventTrigger(() => {
    playSound("Assets/Sounds/CustomExplosion.ogg");
});
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Assets Not Loading  
- **Cause**: Incorrect file paths or incompatible formats.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Verify file paths and ensure they match references in scripts.  
  2. Convert assets to supported formats if necessary.  

### Issue: Performance Drops  
- **Cause**: High-resolution textures or complex models.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Optimize assets for performance (e.g., reduce texture resolution).  
  2. Limit the number of active custom assets.  

---

## Best Practices  

- Use lightweight assets to minimize performance impact.  
- Document asset locations and references for future updates.  
- Share custom assets with the community to foster collaboration.
