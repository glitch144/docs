# Creating Persistent Worlds in Arma Reforger  

Persistent worlds allow player actions to have lasting impacts, such as constructing bases, capturing territories, or altering the environment. This guide will show you how to implement persistence in your Arma Reforger server.

## Overview  

Persistence involves saving and loading data like:  
- Player progress (e.g., inventory, score).  
- World states (e.g., destroyed buildings, captured zones).  

---

## Steps to Create a Persistent World  

### Step 1: Save Data  
Use Enforce Script to save player and world data:  
```javascript
// Save player progress
onPlayerLeave(player => {
    let playerName = player.getName();
    let playerData = {
        health: player.getHealth(),
        score: player.getScore()
    };
    saveData(playerName, playerData);
    log(`Progress saved for ${playerName}`);
});
```

---

### Step 2: Load Data  
Restore data when players rejoin or missions reload:  
```javascript
// Load player progress
onPlayerJoin(player => {
    let playerName = player.getName();
    let playerData = loadData(playerName);
    if (playerData) {
        player.setHealth(playerData.health);
        player.setScore(playerData.score);
        log(`Progress loaded for ${playerName}`);
    }
});
```

---

### Step 3: Persist World States  
Save and restore world states like captured zones:  
```javascript
// Save captured zones
onGameSave(() => {
    let capturedZones = getCapturedZones(); // Assume this function exists
    saveData("capturedZones", capturedZones);
    log("World state saved: Captured zones");
});

// Load captured zones
onGameLoad(() => {
    let capturedZones = loadData("capturedZones");
    if (capturedZones) {
        restoreCapturedZones(capturedZones); // Assume this function exists
        log("World state loaded: Captured zones");
    }
});
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Data Not Saving  
- **Cause**: Missing `saveData()` calls or incorrect keys.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Verify that `saveData()` is called with unique keys.  
  2. Check server logs for errors during saving.  

### Issue: Data Corruption  
- **Cause**: Improper data formatting or incomplete saves.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Use JSON-compatible formats for saved data.  
  2. Validate data before saving or loading.  

---

## Best Practices  

- Use descriptive keys for saved data (e.g., `player-stats`, `world-state`).  
- Regularly back up saved data to prevent loss.  
- Test persistence systems thoroughly before deploying them to production.
