## Overview  

Multiplayer missions require additional considerations, such as player roles, team balancing, and synchronization. Proper planning ensures a smooth experience for all players.  

---

## Steps to Create a Multiplayer Mission  

### Step 1: Define Player Roles  
Assign roles to players based on their objectives:  
- **Attackers**: Capture objectives or eliminate enemies.  
- **Defenders**: Protect objectives or hold positions.  

Example Role Assignment:  
```table
| Role       | Objective                 | Equipment          |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Attacker   | Capture control points    | Rifles, Grenades   |
| Defender   | Defend control points     | Machine Guns, Armor|
```

---

### Step 2: Balance Teams  
Ensure teams are balanced by:  
- Limiting the number of players per team.  
- Distributing resources evenly.  

---

### Step 3: Synchronize Events  
Use Enforce Script to synchronize events across all players:  

```javascript
// Synchronize mission start
onMissionStart(() => {
    broadcastMessage("The mission has started!");
    spawnEnemies("EnemyBase", 10);
});
```

---

### Step 4: Deploy the Mission  
1. Save the mission file.  
2. Upload it to your serverâ€™s `Missions` folder.  
3. Reference the mission in `server.cfg`:  
   ```properties
   mission=MyMultiplayerMission
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: Players Out of Sync  
- **Cause**: Missing synchronization scripts.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Use `broadcast()` functions to ensure all players receive updates.  
  2. Test synchronization in multiplayer mode.  

### Issue: Imbalanced Gameplay  
- **Cause**: Unequal resources or objectives.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Adjust equipment and spawn rates for fairness.  
  2. Gather feedback from players to identify imbalances.  

---

## Best Practices  

- Communicate objectives clearly to players.  
- Regularly update missions to keep them fresh and engaging.  
- Monitor server logs for issues during multiplayer sessions.
